# MusicWrangler
A collection of Python scripts to automate the process of finding, downloading, converting, and organizing a digital music library. This workflow is designed to take a simple list of songs and turn it into a neatly organized, flat-directory music collection suitable for any MP3 player, car stereo, or local media library.
